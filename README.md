# NNG4

This is the lean4 version of the classical *Natural Number Game* by Kevin Buzzard. It uses the [Lean4 Game Engine](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4game) and is running live at [adam.math.hhu.de](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/game/nng).

Contributions are welcome, documentation and game engine are just still in development.
