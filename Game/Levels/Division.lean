World "Division"
Title "Division World"

Introduction
"
  This is the world in which we define `a ∣ b`. We will also prove
  standart facts about it. In particular, that ist is a partial order.

  The definition of `a ∣ b` is that \"There exists a number `c` such
  that `b = c * a`\" So we will use tactics used to prove \"exists\"
  theorems.

  Click on \"Start\" to proceed.
