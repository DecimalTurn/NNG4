Introduction
"
Let's start with an easy one: no induction needed. Your two new theorems
are `mul_zero` and `mul_succ`; click on their names on the right in the
\"Multiplication\" tab **TODO** what tab?

As a side note, the lemmas about addition are still available in your inventory
in the lemma tab \"Add\" while the new lemmas about multiplication appear in the
tab \"Mul\".
