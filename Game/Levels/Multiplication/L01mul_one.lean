Introduction

See the new \"Mul\" tab in your lemmas, containing `mul_zero` and `mul_succ`.

Let's start with a warm-up: no induction needed for this one,
because we know `1` is a successor.

DefinitionDoc Mul as "*" "
  `Mul a b`, with notation `a * b`, is the usual
  product of natural numbers. Internally it is
  via two axioms:

  * `mul_zero a : a * 0 = 0`

  * `mul_succ a b : a * succ b = a * b + a`

Other theorems about naturals, such as `zero_mul`,
are proved by induction from these two basic theorems.
