World "AdvMultiplication"
Title "Advanced Multiplication World"

Introduction
"
Advanced Addition World proved various implications
involving addition, such as `x + y = x → y = 0`. These lemmas
are used to prove basic facts about ≤ in ≤ World. In
Advanced Multiplication World we prove analogous
facts about multiplication, such as `x * y = x → y = 1`,
but only under the hypothesis `x ≠ 0`. This will prepare
us for Divisibility World.
