# Tutorial world

This file defines Tutorial World. Like all worlds, this world
has a name, a title, an introduction, and most importantly
a finite set of levels (imported above). Each level has a weighting
and this determines the order of the levels.

Introduction
"
In this world we introduce two basic tactics (`rfl` and `rw`).
We also introduce several mathematical concepts: the (natural) numbers `â„•`,
explicit examples of numbers such as 0 and 3, and addition of two numbers.
The final boss is to prove that `2 + 2 = 4`. Good luck!
