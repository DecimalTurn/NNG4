Introduction
"
Our remaining job if we want to cover all cases of addition,
is defining `x + succ d`, assuming that we already know the answer to `x + d`.
Clearly `x + succ d` is one more than `x + d`, so it's the number after `x + d`.
Thus it makes sense to define a family of hypotheses

* `add_succ (a b : â„•) : a + succ b = succ (a + b)`

This axiom tells you that you can move a `succ` left over an `+`.

We can now state the theorem about the successor function which has been
part of our mental model: `succ n = n + 1`. See if you can rewrite your
way to a proof of it.
